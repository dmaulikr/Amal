Amal
====

Amal is an iOS app that tracks daily amal (deeds) progress via an active reminder. This is a project made for MDEC ICON2 (ICONapps) at the end of Dec '11. Coded in 2 months (Part Time). Also, my first try on Obj-C programming.

Users can create a list of amal that they do whether it’s on a daily basis, weekly basis, or monthly basis. 

It will have a daily pop up reminder to prompt user to log in their amal for the day. 

At the end of the day, user will be able to view their score and performance.

Example scenario of using this app:
==================================

Ahmad is a busy entrepreneur. He struggles to finish all his daily business tasks, while at the same time, to maintain a good relationship with Allah through daily Quran recitation, Dhuha prayer, Daily Mathurat, and et cetera. 

One fine day, he discovers our app, Amal and immediately downloads it. Ahmad created his list of amal in the app, and set the reminder to pop up every day at 11pm before he went to sleep. 

The next day, Ahmad continue his normal life. On that day, he only manages to read 5 pages of quran, and missed his daily Mathurat. At 11 o’clock that night, after brushing his teeth, Ahmad’s iPhone suddenly beeps.

>“Do you want to log in your amal for today? It’ll take seconds. Promise.”

And Ahmad tap the Yes button. 

Because he only created 3 amals, the app brings him to 3 question in a wizard-ish UI. He answers Yes, Yes and No with only 3 taps. Quick and easy.

Ahmad chose to view the score after answering all questions, and the app brings him to see his score.

He gets a 66%.

Ahmad says, 

>“I love this app. This is just the coolest app ever!”.
